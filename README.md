# Tic Tac Toe by Nawal Ali

## Overview

I rendered a tictactoe gameboard to play in a browser which switches turns between two players(a cat image and
dog image). The game will display which player has won once a player selects three squares in a row.
It will also display if there is a tie (no win).

## Objectives
- Render a Tic Tac Toe game in the browser

- Display the winner
- Include separate HTML, CSS and Javascript files
- Deploy game online using Firebase
