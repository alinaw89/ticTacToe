## Overview

I rendered a tictactoe gameboard using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap 3.3.4 and jQuery 2.1.3 for a General Assembly project. In order to play, the user will load the game in their browser by clicking the game link or loading the index.html file. The user will then be able to play. The game will notify the user when a player has won. It will also display if there is a tie (no win). Should the user have any questions on the code, please refer to the comments in the index.html and tictactoe.js files.


## Approach Taken:

User Story 1: User should see a tic tac toe board on the main page.

User Story 2: User should be able to click the board and place a Cat or a Dog image in any space they choose.

User Story 3: User should be able to alternate turns between Cat image and Dog image.

User Story 4: User should be able to win if user selects three Cat or Dog images in a row.

User Story 5: Game should display a draw if there is no winner.


## Instructions

1. The player should see a tic tac toe game in the browser after loading the index.html file.
1. The game automatically is set to start where Player#1 is the Cat and Player #2 is the Dog.
2. Player#1 and Player#2 alternate turns by selecting one square at a time on the game board.
3. Once a player selects three squares in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), that player will win the game and a prompt will show up indicating who the winner is. A scoreboard will also reflect the current amount of wins between both players.
4. If no player is able to win, the game will be over.
5. Players can reset the game at any given point.
